# MCP server for Obsidian

MCP server to interact with Obsidian via the Local REST API community plugin.

## Components

### Tools

The server implements multiple tools to interact with Obsidian:

- list_files_in_vault: Lists all files and directories in the root directory of your Obsidian vault
- list_files_in_dir: Lists all files and directories in a specific Obsidian directory
- get_file_contents: Return the content of a single file in your vault.
- search: Search for documents matching a specified text query across all files in the vault
- patch_content: Insert content into an existing note relative to a heading, block reference, or frontmatter field.
- append_content: Append content to a new or existing file in the vault.

### Example prompts

Its good to first instruct Claude to use Obsidian. Then it will always call the tool.

The use prompts like this:
- Get the contents of the last architecture call note and summarize them
- Search for all files where Azure CosmosDb is mentioned and quickly explain to me the context in which it is mentioned
- Summarize the last meeting notes and put them into a new note 'summary meeting.md'. Add an introduction so that I can send it via email.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following required variable:

```
OBSIDIAN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Without this API key, the server will not be able to function.

## Quickstart

      }
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

## Development

### Building

To prepare the package for distribution:

1. Sync dependencies and update lockfile:
```bash
uv sync
```

### Debugging

Since MCP servers run over stdio, debugging can be challenging. For the best debugging
experience, we strongly recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).

You can launch the MCP Inspector via [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) with this command:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory /path/to/mcp-obsidian run mcp-obsidian
```

Upon launching, the Inspector will display a URL that you can access in your browser to begin debugging.

You can also watch the server logs with this command:

```bash
tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-mcp-obsidian.log
```
